It is designed for the way developers commonly write documentation in their own code -- with simple markdown files. About You may be wondering why you would want to generate a static site for your project, without doing the typical \"wiki\" thing of consolidating all documentation within a single docs folder or using a single README file. My repository is too big for a single documentation source. Sometimes it isn't really feasible to consolidate all documentation within an upper level docs directory. This is often the case with medium/large repositories. In general, if your code base is too large to fit well within a single include directory, your code base is probably also too large for documentation to fit within a single docs directory. Since it's typically easier to keep documentation up to date when it lives as close to the code as possible, it is better to create multiple sources for documentation. My repository is too simple for advanced documentation. If your code base is very very large, something like the monorepo plugin might better fit your needs. For most other medium+ repositories that have grown over time, you probably have scattered documentation throughout your code. By combining all of that documentation while keeping folder structure, you can better surface and collaborate with others. And, let's face it. That documentation is probably all in markdown, since github renders it nicely. I want a pretty documentation site without the hassle. Finally, you may be interested in this plugin if you have a desire for stylized documentation, but don't want to invest the time/energy in replicating information you already have in your README.md files, and you want to keep them where they are (thank you very much).

The Basics If you are looking to help to with a code contribution this project uses mkdocs for documentation generation, python for the plugin, along with a splattering of markdown and shellscript . I've included my vscode workspace and a docker development container. Read about how I develop using vscode and docker . If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the issues we have in the github issue tracker . How to Contribute Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in this project? Here's a quick rundown! Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add in the issue tracker . Don't see your issue? Submit one! Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub account. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name. Clone the repository to your local machine. bash git clone https://github.com/github-username/mkdocs-simple-plugin.git Create a new branch for your fix. bash git checkout -b branch-name-here Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add. Add the file contents of the changed files to the \"snapshot\" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index. bash git add <file_list> Insert a short message of the changes made to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. bash git commit -m\"Insert a short message of the changes made here\" Push the changes to the remote repository bash git push origin branch-name-here. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so \"Added more log outputting to resolve #4352\". In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it! Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
